                    What is JavaScript?

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight"><span class="bold">JavaScript (js)</span> is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is 
                        used by several websites for scripting the webpages.</span> It is an interpreted, full-fledged 
                    programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to 
                    an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the 
                    webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all 
                    other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web 
                    applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional 
                    website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name 
                    was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the 
                    market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses 
                    JavaScript as their scripting and query language.

                    <br>
                    <li>
                        All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.

                    <li>
                        JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast(depending on the operation).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.

                    <li>
                        It is a case-sensitive language.

                    <li>
                        JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.

                    In 1993, Mosaic, the first popular web browser, came into existence. In the year 
                    1994, Netscape was founded by Marc Andreessen. He realized that the web needed to 
                    become more dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language' was believed to be provided to HTML to 
                    make web designing easy for designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 
                    1995, the company recruited Brendan Eich intending to implement and embed Scheme 
                    programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan could start, the company 
                    merged with Sun Microsystems for adding Java into its Navigator so that it could 
                    compete with Microsoft over the web technologies and platforms. Now, two languages 
                    were there: Java and the scripting language. Further, Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code of Javascript named 
                    'Mocha'. Later, the marketing team replaced the name with 'LiveScript'. But, due to 
                    trademark reasons and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was 
                    finally renamed to 'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript came into existence.
